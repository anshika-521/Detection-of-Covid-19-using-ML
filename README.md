# Detection-of-covid-19-using-ML
Detects Covid-19 using X-RAY

The Objective of this project is to learn how to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using
machine learning in Python. In this project we are going to make a model that can predict
whether the X-Ray image contains coronavirus or not.
